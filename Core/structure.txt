Every folder implements a concept. It must contain the implementation and interface. 
If an external library is used, it's zip shall be kept in the folder.

Every folder has to have an include file with .inc ending. It sets the relevant makros to determine,
which implementation for the methods should be used.

To determine this makros, every folder has to have an config.cpp file, which implements tests and runs them.
Tests are:
	1.: Check for UB, memory leaks,... in the tests                                   (done with sanatizers)
	2.: Check if the tests return correct results for some inputs               
	3.: Bench the tests, find the fastest and set the correct makros in the .inc file

For this, it uses the global misc.cpp file which implements methods to benchmark functions and generate the include-files.
There should also be a global configure.exe which sets all configurations for the indiviual folders.

The benchmarks are analysed with VTune and Amplifier and for debugging, gdb is used.
